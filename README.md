# Modification for Minecraft 1.19.2: New Type of Anvil

This modification adds a new type of anvil to Minecraft, which can be crafted from a regular anvil. The new anvil has several improvements compared to the original version.

**Features:**
- The new anvil does not break and will last you much longer.
- It requires less experience to use, making it more accessible and cost-effective.
- The anvil resets the penalty for usage, allowing you to use it without restrictions.

This modification is supported on Minecraft version 1.19.2 with Fabric Loader version 0.14.14.
